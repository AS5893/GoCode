     <h1 class="introduction heading"> What are Smart Cities</h1>
    <h3 class="introduction">  Smart city refers to the new generation of information technology,   synthetically using
        the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, spatial information integration, etc. Its
        main features are digitization, intelligence, networking, interaction, collaboration and
        convergence. Through overall perception and interconnection among people and
        things along with their behaviors, it substantially optimizes and promotes the
        efficiency and effectiveness of city running system, creating a sustainable city with a
        better environment, more convenient life and more resource-saving. </h3>

    <h3 class="introduction"> According to projections, nearly 70% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. While some megacities are already struggling to cope with the current inflow of people, we need to create smart cities in order to make these urban areas more liveable and truly sustainable.

            How will cities look in the next century

            <h3 class="introduction">
                The city of the future will have the infrastructure and transportation links to address the needs of citizens of all generations. 
              <br> 
               
            Each city will build new housing options to enable older citizens to "age in place."

            <h1 class="introduction heading"> THE END</h1>
            <h3 class="introduction">
                When we look back in a decade and a half, our familiar surroundings will remind us of a familiar lessonâ€“one just as clear today with a glance back to the turn of the century: most of what we need to build better cities is already here. The cities we can have in 2030 are the cities we could have had today. With all hope, a future reflection on the past will be able to see us more past the our biggest impediment. In the future we will leave behind our focus of creating ways that allow us to change as little as possible and start embracing the growth within all of the possibilities of change.
